# Boston Airbnb Analysis Project

## 1. Installations
To run this project, I utilized Jupyter Notebook on the Anaconda platform. The following libraries were used:

- **Python version:** 3.9.13
- **numpy:** 1.22.4
- **pandas:** 1.4.4
- **seaborn:** 0.11.2
- **matplotlib:** 3.5.2
- **scikit-learn:** 1.0.2

To install Anaconda, follow the instructions provided on the [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

## 2. Project Motivation
This project was conducted as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program. The datasets used were sourced from the Kaggle repository and include listings and calendar data for Boston Airbnb listings. The project follows the CRISP-DM framework, which comprises the following steps:

1. **Business Understanding**
2. **Data Understanding**
3. **Data Preparation**
4. **Modeling**
5. **Evaluation**
6. **Deployment**

The primary objectives of this project are to address the following key questions:

- **Most Popular Neighborhood in Boston:** Identify the most popular neighborhoods and compare the average price and review scores across these neighborhoods.
- **Factors Influencing Airbnb Prices:** Determine the factors that are most influential in determining Airbnb prices in Boston.
- **Seasonal Price and Availability Fluctuations:** Analyze whether Airbnb listing prices and availability fluctuate based on the season.

## 3. File Descriptions
- `listings.csv`: This file contains information about Airbnb listings in Boston.
- `calendar.csv`: This file includes data on the availability and pricing of Airbnb listings in Boston over time.
- `BostonAirbnb_Analysis_Project.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the project code and analysis, including data exploration, visualization, and modeling.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, including its motivation, goals, and instructions for running the code.

## 4. How to Interact with the Project
1. **Cloning the Repository:** Start by cloning or downloading the repository to your local machine. You can do this by clicking on the "Clone or download" button and selecting your preferred method.
2. **Installing Dependencies:** Before running the project code, ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. Anaconda provides a convenient way to manage Python packages.
3. **Accessing the Datasets:** The datasets required for the project are included in the repository. You can access the 'Listings.csv' and 'Calendar.csv' files for analysis.
4. **Running the Jupyter Notebook:** Open the 'BostonAirbnb_Analysis_Project.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook to interact with the project code. Execute each cell in the notebook to run the code and observe the results.
5. **Exploring the Analysis and Results:** The Jupyter Notebook contains sections organized based on the three key questions addressed in the project. Each section includes charts, analysis, and insights derived from the data.
